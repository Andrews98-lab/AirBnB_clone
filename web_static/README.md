# 0x01. AirBnB Clone - Web Static

This repository contains the "0x01. AirBnB Clone - Web Static" project, which is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The project focuses on creating static HTML and CSS files for a simplified version of the AirBnB website.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop the front-end part of an Airbnb clone website by implementing static HTML and CSS files. The static pages will be visually appealing and responsive, utilizing CSS styling. The project covers essential concepts such as HTML, CSS, responsiveness, and layout.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

- **index.html:** This file serves as the main entry point to the website.
- **styles:** A directory containing the CSS files.
- **images:** A directory containing the images used in the project.
- **README.md:** The readme file you are currently reading.

## Getting Started

To start working on the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Andrews98-lab/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

3. Explore the project files and directories to familiarize yourself with the structure and organization.

## Usage

To view the static pages of the Airbnb clone website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
